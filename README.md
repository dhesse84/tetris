Tetris for Excel

This is a game of Tetris that runs within an Excel sheet.  It requires ActiveX natively, which means it only works in Excel for Windows.
Be sure to allow permissions/enable content on the sheet in order to play.

Enjoy!

This version is a non-commercial, fan-made project in homage to the original Tetris. Tetris is property of The Tetris Company, LLC.
