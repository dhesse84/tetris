Tetris for Excel

This is a game of Tetris within an Excel sheet.  It works natively in Windows, but no on Mac due to the limitations of ActiveX emulation.
Be sure to allow permissions/enable content on the sheet in order to play.

This version is a non-commercial, fan-made project made in homage to the original Tetris. Tetris is property of The Tetris Company, LLC.
